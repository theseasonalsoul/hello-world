Learning to use github

Working towards managing a Wordpress implementation with Github. 

# Building a curated, edited news source based on git. Every article has branches and anyone can suggest a pull request to update the master branch. 

Everything is written in Markdown. 

The site does need to be monetized, and needs to pay authors. 

It should also pay copy readers, forkers, mergers, etc.
